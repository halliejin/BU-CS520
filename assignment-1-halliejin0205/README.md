# MET CS 520 Assignment 1 ##

**Please read the assignment document in Blackboard carefully before proceeding.**

Submitting your work:

* Commit and push your code according to the instructions in the ___Assignment Instructions___ guide in Blackboard.
* Do not create any files unless otherwise instructed. Your work should be done in the `.java` files that have already been created for you.
* Please don't commit/push anything to the repository but your assignment work.
  Do not submit compiled `.class` files.
* At the top of the class file that contains
  `public static void main(String[] args)`, replace "_YOUR NAME_"
  with your first and last name.
* You may commit and/or push as much as you wish before the deadline; when we grade your work, we only see the latest version of your code.
* It is entirely _your_ responsibility to ensure that your code has been successfully published to GitHub. Go to your repo in GitHub online and confirm that the files that appear there contain what you expect them to contain.

Reminders:

* Do NOT search online for help with the assignment. If you don't understand why we are
  telling you that, please go back and watch the recording of the intro session again.
* If you are having trouble or have any questions, contact your facilitator and we
  will be glad to assist. This is the ONLY approved way to get help.
* All work must be your own.
  Do not work with or consult with your classmates (or anyone else) on the assignment.
* Submission of your assignment constitutes acceptance of these rules.
